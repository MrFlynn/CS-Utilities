# course-code
A collection of miscellaneous scripts and prorgams I've written for 
university math and computer science courses. These scripts were probably
used in solving homework problems or to help further my understanding of
some topic covered in said courses.

This is also an environment for me to explore other languages that I am 
interested in. Currently I am playing around with Rust and Haskell.
