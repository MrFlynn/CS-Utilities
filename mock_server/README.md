# Search Engine Mock Server

This is a mock server used to test out the frontend of a search engine being 
created for my information retrieval class. It's designed to test out 
requesting and displaying results as well as pagination.

## How to use it
You need Python 3.8 or newer installed.

```bash
pip install flask
python main.py
```
